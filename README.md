# VndbSharp
A C# [Vndb](https://vndb.org/) API Library. #OriginalNamingScheme

VndbSharp is a C# library for the Visual Novel Database API
  - Supports TLS (Secure Connections)
  - Support for most filters and flags at this time (Jan 2017, Api version 2.27)
  - Easily Extensible

## Usage
Check out the [VndbConsole projects](VndbConsoleCore/Program.cs) for basic usage guidance. The one `Program.cs` file is used for both the .Net Framework and .Net Core projects, but works in both. This shows that the library can be used from either the .Net Framework (4.6+) or .Net Core (.Net Standard 1.3+)
